# File-Pattern-Manager

A nice little utility too that automates multiple file creation and renaming. A trivial task for Linux jockeys, a tiring one for the "non-enlightened".<br>
Oh! And there's a GUI too! (means you get buttons to click! click! and other stuff ;) )

## Features :boom: ???

- [ ] Create many files in a go!
- [ ] File names with up to 4 string/number patterns
- [ ] Awesome GUI
- [ ] Rename file names matching given pattern (non-regex)
- [ ] Rename file names matching given Regex pattern
- [ ] Recursive rename on directories

coming soon :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

## TODO

- [X] Create GUI
- [ ] Logic for pattern generation
- [ ] Funcationality #1 (create files)
- [ ] Logic for pattern search in dir
- [ ] Funcationality #2 (rename files)
